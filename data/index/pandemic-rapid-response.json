  "description": [
    "Disaster has struck! Cities around the world are in desperate need of food, water, vaccines, and other supplies. You and your team belong to the Crisis Response Unit (CRU), an elite team of doctors and specialists. With a specially equipped plane, you are uniquely capable of providing life-saving aid &mdash; anytime, anywhere.",
    "Pandemic: Rapid Response is a race against time. Roll dice to create supplies, fly the plane, and make deliveries to cities in need. As the timer counts down, you must quickly coordinate and work together to react to new disasters. Will you and your team be able to respond in time?",
    "The nations of the world have pooled their resources and assembled a diverse crew. Each of the seven unique role cards features its own ability. The Analyst, Adjoua Soro, is able to re-roll the dice up to two additional times. The Engineer, Soojin Sohn, can change any die result with a plane to a different symbol. Take turns as quickly as possible, using your role's unique ability and strategically allocating your dice to be as efficient as possible when creating supplies.",
    "When you're ready for a new challenge, adjust the difficulty level or add crisis cards for a greater variety of obstacles to overcome. Now hurry &mdash; the timer is counting down and the world needs your help!",
