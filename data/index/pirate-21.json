    "Pirate 21 is competitive card game for 2-6 players. Each player tries to get 21 without going over. Sound familiar? It is, but in this version of 21 you have pirates that can knock an opponent out of the round, mates and captains that can swap cards, and princesses to defend you. Draw your cards, and bring your best trash-talking pirate voice to the table."
