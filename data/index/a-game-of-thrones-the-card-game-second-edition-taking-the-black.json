    "From the publisher's website:",
    "Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.",
    "   &ndash;George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones",
    "Start at the beginning of A Song of Ice and Fire with Taking the Black, the first Chapter Pack in the Westeros cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game. As A Song of Ice and Fire begins, Westeros is at peace. But this deceptive calm will not long remain. Already, conflict between the Great Houses is on the horizon. You can take your place at the very beginning of the story with Taking the Black. In the Westeros cycle, the focus rests on the first book of A Song of Ice and Fire. Here, you&rsquo;ll also find iconic characters like Renly Baratheon, the Hound, and Maester Luwin for the first time. You&rsquo;ll also find four brand-new plot cards in this expansion, two neutral and two faction-specific. Begin your journey to the Iron Throne!"
