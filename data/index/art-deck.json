    "Art Deck is a drawing game for 2-6 players. Players are dealt cards from a deck of instructional sentence fragments (&quot;what do to do&quot;, &quot;how to do it&quot; and &quot;something that makes it difficult&quot;) and deal out a starting sentence with one of each. (eg. &quot;Draw eyes / across half the page / without taking your marker off the page.&quot;)",
    "On your turn, you play a card onto the sentence, replacing the previous one in that position, and then contribute to a communal drawing, obeying the sentence's instruction.",
    "The game continues until someone plays a &quot;sign your name&quot; card and signs the artwork, completing it."
