  "description": [
    "In the card game Diamonsters, each player starts the game with an identical hand of cards, each of which has a cartoonish picture of a monster and a value from one to five. Each round one card is dealt from the deck face up. Some monsters are more valuable than others, and some eat the diamonds found on other cards. Players attempt to win the round by playing the highest card in front of them, but cards of equal value cancel out. The winner of each round adds his winning card &mdash; plus the face-up card &mdash; to his collection of cards won. The first player to collect three cards of the same value or cards worth five diamonds wins the round."
