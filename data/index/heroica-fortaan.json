  "description": [
    "LEGO's Heroica series represents a classic dungeon game. The players move through tunnels, collecting treasure and fighting enemies. Conflict is resolved by dice rolls; the die results can be a number or a symbol, which might allow the player to use a special weapon. Instead of a character sheet, the players have equipment &quot;backpacks&quot; which can be filled with weapons, potions, keys, etc., depending on what they find during their adventure.",
    "Heroica: Fortaan is a castle, so the players move through rooms on a grid of grey flat LEGO bricks. The set-up includes a throne room and various gates to be passed through (provided one finds the right keys).",
    "Heroica: Fortaan can be combined with any or all other games in the LEGO Heroica series."
