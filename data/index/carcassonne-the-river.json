    "Der Fluss (The River) is a mini-expansion for Carcassonne. It adds twelve river tiles. All the familiar landscape elements are also present.",
    "The river tiles are placed first, after that the game continues as normal. No followers may be placed on the river so the scoring is the same as in the basic game.",
    "Part of the Carcassonne series."
