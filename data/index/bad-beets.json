  "description": [
    "Bad Beets is a fast-paced bluffing card game in which players must eat their vegetables &mdash; well, get rid of their vegetables through any means that they can.",
    "Each player starts the game with eight beet cards that they must finish before they can leave the dinner table. On a turn, a player takes one of the two cards in hand, places it facedown on the table, then takes an action &mdash; from feeding the dog, sharing with another player, tattling on someone, or actually eating a beet &mdash; and the other players decide whether to allow the action or call the player on it. If the player is called out, they take the action only if they have the proper card in hand and the tattletale gets punished with an extra beet."
