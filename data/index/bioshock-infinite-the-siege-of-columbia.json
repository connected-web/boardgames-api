  "description": [
    "In BioShock Infinite: The Siege of Columbia, players will play as either the Founders or the Vox Populi and will build up an army to fight for control of Columbia by taking ground and completing important objectives. At the same time, they'll be using their influence to sway various events that arise. They'll also find themselves having to deal with Booker and Elizabeth, who are running around Columbia creating havoc.",
    "The game has players combating one another, stealing objectives from under each other's noses, assassinating leaders, destroying strongholds, bidding against each other for control of unfolding events, and more. The first faction to 10 victory points wins. Because there are only two factions, the game can be played by two players in a head-to-head format, or by four players paired off in two teams."
