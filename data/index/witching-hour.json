    "Troubles a-brewin'! It's exam time at School of Sorcery, and the mischievous witches have crafted their strongest potions and hexes to win the coveted Witches Cup. A little eye of newt, toe of frog and wool of bat have strewn together magical objects with the ability to foil their fellow witches. Mix your potions, practice your spells, and prepare for a battle of magical proportions!",
    "Witching Hour is a card game in which players compete over three rounds to control the Witches Cup. Armed with enchanted objects, they attack, defend, and use specialty abilities to hex their rivals. The player with the fewest points at the end wins the Cup."
