    "Discover the ancient art form of Tea Dragon care-taking within The Tea Dragon Society Card Game, based on the graphic novel The Tea Dragon Society. Create a bond between yourself and your Tea Dragon that grows as you progress through the seasons, creating memories to share forever.",
    "Each player's deck represents their own Tea Dragon. From turn to turn, players choose to draw a card &mdash; triggering effects and strengthening their position &mdash; or buy a card, improving their deck or scoring points. The game takes place over four seasons, starting in spring and ending in winter. At the end of winter, the player who has the most points wins."
