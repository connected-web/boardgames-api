    "Yam Yam is a card game that lets young children decide how much longer their hedgehog family can safely stay outside to eat before snow suddenly starts to fall.",

That's why you will have to think twice after each food card that you draw &mdash; whether it really is time already for another one of your hedgehogs to hibernate.",
