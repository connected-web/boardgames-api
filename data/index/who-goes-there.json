    "Who Goes There? is a cooperative game of growing paranoia. At the beginning of the game, all players are human and there is no reason not to fully trust the other players. As the temperature drops and mistakes are made, players start to doubt everything and everyone around them.",
    "You must build, trade, and upgrade to better your chances of surviving the perils of the camp, and the alien entity that is now running loose.",
    "Players must survive the elements and escape on the helicopter. and hope that anyone else on board is who they appear to be."
