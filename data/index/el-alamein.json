  "description": [
    "A sequel to Arclight's deckbuilding game Barba*Rossa (&#227;&#129;&#176;&#227;&#130;&#139;&#227;&#129;&#176;&#226;&#152;&#133;&#227;&#130;&#141;&#227;&#129;&#163;&#227;&#129;&#149;), El*Alamein depicts the first battle of El Alamein during WWII, as the Axis powers thrust through Africa to conquer Alexandria. Like its predecessor, the artwork in El*Alamein consists of scantily clad  (ecchi) manga girls, although a historical edition featuring photographs is also available.",
    "Although it's technically possible to use the cards in both sets together, El*Alamein is first and foremost a game on its own, and is better described as a &quot;compatible sequel&quot; than a standalone expansion."
