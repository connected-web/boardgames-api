  "description": [
    "Tuscany: Expand the World of Viticulture significantly extends the original game of winemaking. Using a tiered system that lets you gradually unlock (&quot;uncork&quot;) a number of new expansions to Viticulture legacy-style in an order that's unique to your game, Tuscany enhances and completes the rustic world that Viticulture introduced. Just like Viticulture, Tuscany plays 2-6 players and has a play time of around 20 minutes per player.",
    "These expansions add asymmetric starting resources, new and advanced visitor cards, an extended game board for actions in all four seasons, special types of worker meeples, and more. What story will you tell as you seek to create the most successful vineyard in Tuscany?"
