    "In Pandemic: In the Lab, the second expansion for Pandemic, you will use a new game board that allows you to move the pawns in a laboratory. The goal of this activity is the same as in the base game &ndash; finding cures for diseases &ndash; but this time in a new way. Behind sealed bio-hazard doors, scientists race against time to sequence diseases, take samples, and test cures.",
    "Pandemic: In the Lab includes four new roles, new Virulent Strain events, and a Worldwide Panic Mutation scenario. Players can compete individually or on rival teams (when playing with four or six players). Can your team work together in the lab to save humanity?",
    "Pandemic: In the Lab requires the base game. Two of the 3 scenarios also require Pandemic: On the Brink to play.",
    "Part of the Pandemic series."
