  "description": [
    "In Kamigmai Battles, you are a God defending your realm from the claim of other mighty deities with the aid of Disciples and Warriors you recruit. Through the efforts of these valiant heroes, you will collect the energy that is your life force. By reducing your foe to 0 energy, you can either vanquish him or make him bend the knee and join you!",
    "You can play as an individual God or as a team of Gods. When playing in in Free-for-All mode with 2 to 6 players, you win by eliminating all of the other Gods or by reaching 25 energy. In a Team Match if you play with four or six players teamed up in pairs of two, one Main God and a Support God. A team wins together if they can eliminate the opposing team's Main God.",
    "Kamigami Battles: Battle of the Nine Realms is an updated version of the title Kanzume Goddess with upgraded God cards that are now 5&quot; x 3.5&quot;. The Warrior and Disciple Cards remain the same size as the original cards."
