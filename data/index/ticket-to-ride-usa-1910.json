This includes 35 new 1910 Destination Tickets, a GlobeTrotter Bonus card for completing the most tickets, 4 Mystery Train Destination Tickets originally provided in the Ticket to Ride: Mystery Train Expansion expansion, and a complete replacement deck of the 141 cards from the original game deck (30 Destination Tickets (4 cards have a reduced value from Ticket to Ride), 110 Train Cards, and 1 Longest Route Bonus Card (Trans America Express)).",
