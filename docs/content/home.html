  <p>We play a lot of board games; at least one board game a day every day of the year since the start of 2018.<p>
  <p>We enjoy this so much we want to share our play stats and experiences through our own website, and use this data to help us decide what game to play next. To make the website and our decision making possible we built this Board Game API.</p>
  <heading>{{icon:book}} API Documentation</heading>
  <p>To help us keep track of our endpoints, and perhaps for other people to use, we have created these docs for the boardgames API. The docs themselves are based on the data that the API provides. Each endpoint should provide suitable documentation in the form of schemas, examples, and test cases.</p>
  <p>Where detail is lacking, please get in touch by raising an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/connected-web/boardgames-api/issues">github page</a>!</p>
